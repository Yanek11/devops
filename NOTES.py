Built-In Functions
    each data type has its own built-in functions
    they can be used only with this data type
    Example:    
        "text".isdigit()
        user_input.split(",") 
            
print("some text")
input(" enter value")
set([1,2,3,4]) - takes a list and converts it to a set
int("20") - takes String and converts it to Integer
