Migrating your Exchange environment from on-premises to Azure is achievable. You can create a highly available and secure email infrastructure in Azure using Exchange Server deployed on Azure Virtual Machines. See next steps:

DONE
1- Create a virtual network in Azure: 
Set up a virtual network in Azure and connect it to your on-premises network using a VPN
gateway or an ExpressRoute connection. This will ensure that your on-premises and Azure
environments are securely connected and can communicate with each other.

2- Deploy Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure:
Deploy at least two Active Directory Domain Controllers in Azure, preferably in different
availability zones, to ensure high availability. Make sure that the Domain Controllers are synced
with your on-premises Active Directory infrastructure.



3- Deploy Exchange Servers in Azure:
Deploy Exchange Server instances on Azure Virtual Machines, following the best practices and
recommended VM sizes for Exchange Server. Deploy the Exchange Servers across multiple
availability zones to ensure high availability.



4- Configure Azure Load Balancer:
Set up an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic among the Exchange Servers. This will
ensure that incoming traffic is distributed evenly and efficiently across the available Exchange
Server instances.

5- Configure SMTP Relay:
Since port 25 is blocked by default in Azure, you'll need to use a third-party SMTP relay
service, such as SendGrid, Mailjet, or another SMTP relay service of your choice, to send
outbound email from your Exchange Servers in Azure. Configure the SMTP relay service
according to the provider's documentation and update your Exchange Server settings to route
outbound email through the relay service.

6- Configure DNS settings:
Update your public DNS records to point to the public IP address of your Azure Load Balancer.
This will ensure that incoming email is directed to your new Exchange infrastructure in Azure.

7- Configure SSL Certificates:
Obtain and configure SSL certificates for your Exchange Servers in Azure. This will ensure
secure communication between your clients and the Exchange Servers.

8- Test the new environment:
Test the new Exchange environment in Azure to ensure that it's functioning correctly and
providing the necessary services, including email delivery, mailbox access, and other features.

9- Decommission the on-premises Exchange infrastructure:
Once you've confirmed that the new Exchange environment in Azure is functioning correctly,
decommission your on-premises Exchange infrastructure.

10- Monitor and optimize:
Continuously monitor your new Exchange environment in Azure using Azure Monitor and
other monitoring tools. Optimize the environment for performance, cost, and security by
following best practices.

By following these steps, you can create a highly available and secure Exchange environment in Microsoft Azure.
